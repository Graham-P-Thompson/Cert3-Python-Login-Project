# Cert3-Python-Login-Project

## Description

I completed this project as part of my IT certificate 3 qualification at Tafe in 2022.

The project is written in Python. It reads from and writes to a .txt file provided to the students as part of the project. 

The project requirements were to write a simple console based login program with a menu of options:
- Login – For users who have previously registered. Username and password to be checked for validity
- Register – Create a new user account
- Passwords – New users given the option to enter their own password or generate one
- Generated passwords – User given the option to choose the password character types – numbers, symbols or letters. The default password
  length should be applied, but users should also be allowed to choose how many characters
- Save file – Usernames and passwords should be saved to a text file accounts.txt
- Exit – Delay for 2 seconds before exit
- View accounts – To display user account information from the accounts.txt file (assuming that only admin have access to this program)
